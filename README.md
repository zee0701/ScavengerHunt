(Henry wants to also see both licenses.txt and changelog files)

# Henry comments 13/April
- Don't have two project directories, as I won't know which one to mark.
- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency.
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there.
- You're still missing a licenses.txt + changelog.md file.
